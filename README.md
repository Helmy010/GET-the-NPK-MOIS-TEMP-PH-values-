This Arduino code is designed to communicate with multiple sensors using the Modbus protocol to retrieve readings from each sensor. 
Here's a simplified explanation:

1. It sets up communication channels for talking to the sensors.

2. It defines commands for each sensor to request specific readings.

3. In the main loop:
   - It retrieves readings from each sensor using the defined commands.
   - It prints out the readings for each sensor on the serial monitor.
   - It delays for a second between each reading.

4. The `HAL_u16Get_Sensor_Read()` function sends commands to the sensors, receives responses, and extracts relevant data from the responses.

Overall, the code communicate with multiple sensors to retrieve readings and display them on the serial monitor or whatever you want to desplay the reading on.
